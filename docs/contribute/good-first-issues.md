# Good First Issues

When issues come into the ponyc GitHub project, as part of our initial triaging of issues, some get marked as good for outside contributors. The general idea behind this label is to make it simple for people who want to contribute to Pony but don't have much time or knowledge about Pony. These issues are a great way to get started with contributing and start learning more about Pony.

Every week, we post a list of the latest "good first issues" from across all of our repositories. You can find the latest list of good first issues in the [contribute stream](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/192795-contribute-to-Pony) in the [Pony Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com).
